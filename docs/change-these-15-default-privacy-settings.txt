If You Care About Data, Change These 15 Default Privacy Settings Right Now
Say no to defaults.

On the Internet, the devil's in the defaults.

You're not reading all those updated data policies flooding
your inbox.  You probably haven't even looked for your privacy
settings. And that's exactly what Facebook, Google and other
tech giants are counting on.

1. Anyone can see all your Facebook friends and all the weird
   pages you follow.  That includes employers, stalkers, identity
   thieves and quite possibly your mother.

  o On your phone's Facebook app, tap the button with three lines,
    then scroll to Settings & Privacy, then tap Settings, and then
    Privacy Settings.  Or use this link on the Web.[1]  Then switch
    Who can see your friends list from Public to Friends — or,
    even better, Only me.

    x Under toolbar > down arrow > Settings  > Privacy - Jun 6, 2018

  o Do the same on that same page [2] with a separate setting for
    Who can see the people, Pages and lists you follow.

  What you give up: Strangers being able to hunt you down or
  discover your interests.

  Unable to find the latter item.


  2. I know what you did last summer … because when people tag
  you in a photo or post, it automatically shows up on your timeline.

  o In the Facebook app under Settings & Privacy, then Settings,
    then Timeline and Tagging (or at this link on the Web)[3] switch
    On the option Review posts you're tagged in before the post
    appears on your timeline.

  What you give up: Letting others post on your behalf — at least
  until you approve each post.

  x Under toolbar > down arrow > Settings  > Privacy > Timeline and Tagging- Jun 6, 2018


  3. Your face belongs to Facebook. By default, it scans all the photos
     and video you share to create digital face IDs — unless you tell
     them hands off your mug.

     o In the Facebook app under Settings & Privacy, then Settings, then
       Face Recognition (or at this link on the Web)[4] switch to No  under
       Do you want Facebook to be able to recognize you in photos and videos?

     What you give up: Facebook won't recommend tagging you in photos,
     and won't give you a heads up when someone else posts a photo of you.

     Do not find face recognition setting.

  4. Don't give it all away to Facebook advertisers, either.  Reminder:
     Each member in North America was worth $82 in advertising to Facebook
     in 2017.

     Advertisers can use very personal data to target you, making Facebook
     ads even creepier than they have to be.

     o In the Facebook app's Settings & Privacy menu, tap Settings, then
       Ad Preferences (or use this link on the Web).  Then tap open the
       section called Your information. There, switch Off ads based on
       your relationship status, employer, job title and education.

     o While you're in Ad Preferences, head down to Ad settings and
       switch to Not allowed for Ads based on data from partners
       and Ads based on your activity on Facebook Company Products
       that you see elsewhere.

     What you give up: More "relevant" ads, which is more of a problem
     for advertisers than for you

  5. Surprise, you're starring in Facebook ads!  Did your
     check not arrive in the mail?  Oh right: Just by "liking"
     a page, you give Facebook advertisers permission to use
     your name in ads they show your friends — and you don't
     get a dime.

     o On your phone under Settings & Privacy, then Settings,
       then Ad Preferences (or at this link on the Web) tap 
       open Ads Settings and switch to No One the setting for
       Ads that include your social actions.

   What you give up: Use of your name by a company you might
   not actually care very much about.
